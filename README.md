  <summary><h3>About me</h3></summary>
  I started my journey as a student in San Diego State University.  During and after completing my courses I spent some time traveling, this experience opened up my eyes in the way I see the world and made me realize how much is out there, which in turn reflects on how I view technology.
  I started my career in start ups and small companies.  In here I did not have the support of dedicated teams for different business aspect so we had to adapt and fix whatever was needed on a daily basis.  This highlighted my adaptability and it's importance in this field.  After moving on to larger companies I still kept that startup mentality in the sense that I need to adapt to whatever the next day comes and ultmately solve things in a way that not only makes sense logically, but as a costumer that it solves their pain points.
